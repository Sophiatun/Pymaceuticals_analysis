**Analysis Summary**

This project involved a comprehensive analysis of test results from 249 mice distributed across 10 drug treatments, including a placebo/control regimen. The examination of specific parameters aimed to identify trends, patterns, and draw conclusions for making informed decisions about anti-cancer medications.

**Key Conclusions:**

1. **Positive Correlation:** The analysis reveals a positive correlation of 0.84 between the weight of mice and tumor size. As mouse weight increases, tumor size tends to increase as well.

2. **Effectiveness of Drug Regimens:**
   - *Top Performers:* Among the four drug regimens analyzed, Capomulin and Ramicane emerged as the most effective in reducing tumor sizes.
   - *Least Effective:* Conversely, the two least effective drugs were identified as Infubinol and Ceftamin.

These findings provide valuable insights into the relationships between weight, tumor size, and the efficacy of different drug regimens. The results can guide decision-making processes for further developments in anti-cancer medications.
